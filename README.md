Dear reader,

In the following folders you will find three different models under the notebook Final_Challenge_Hubacher_Freire_Jenni.ipynb.
Two are made with the transfer learning method and one with the CNN method. 

You will find the pictures in the raw_data folder.

The models, which you can view, can be found in the folder "models".
In this folder, the model transfer_learning_trainables_true.h5 is the most promising.
But the model resnet_model-2.h5 also achieves good accuracy.
In the CNN method, the 2_conv_128_nodes-Batchnorm-Dropout-20220219112148.h5 model was the best, although this lags far behind the other two.
 
See the notebook comparison.ipynb for a comparison between the different models created during the elaboration.
We hope you enjoy looking through our project.

With best regards

Bernardo, Guido and Lars
